# DiceGuessingGameWithCheats
Python based game where the user determines the sum of two dices to win.

There is a cheating function where the user can choose to cheat, but both of the answers provided will be incorrect followed by a message that states "Cheaters never prosper."
However, if one can determine the pattern of the cheating answers, it is very easy to find the correct answer after asking for help.
There is a 50/50 chance to get the correct or an incorrect answer, but even with the incorrect answers there is a pattern to find the correct ones.

The game allows the user to try an infinite number of times without repercussions unless the cheat or the reveal answer functions are used.

This was made as a fun project for a class. If you would like some code to feed your eyes, go ahead and explore :)
